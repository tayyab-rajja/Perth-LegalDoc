          <h5>What is a hybrid trust?</h5>
          <p>
            “Hybrid trust” is not a defined term. A “hybrid trust” generally
            means a trust that combines some of the features of a fixed trust
            with some of the features of a non-fixed trust, ie a discretionary
            trust, to create a new form of trust that better suits some
            commercial applications. Different lawyers do this in different
            ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most common approach is to allocate an agreed number of units to
            each unit holder. Like unit trusts, the units entitle the unit
            holder to a fixed proportion of the net income of the trust each
            year. Typically these units also entitle the unit holder to a fixed
            proportion of any capital distributions. If nothing else happens the
            hybrid trust works like a fixed trust: each unit holder is entitled
            to a fixed percentage of the trust’s income and capital gains each
            year and must include this amount in their assessable income for tax
            purposes. For example, if net income is $1,000, and there are 100
            units owned equally by each of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, each
            of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young are entitled to $250 and they must
            each include $250 in their income tax return each year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes hybrid trusts operate this way year after year, just like
            a fixed trust. But circumstances may arise where distributing net
            income between unitholders in their proportions is not optimal. A
            more discretionary approach may be needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The hybrid trust deed contains some special rules to help out here.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, if each unitholder agrees, net income may be distributed
            other than proportionally. For example, it may be instead agreed
            that each of Crosby and Stills are entitled to say 30% of net
            income, and each of Nash and Young are entitled to 20%. This means
            each of Crosby and Stills receive $300 and must include $300 in
            their income tax return. And each of Nash and Young receive $200 and
            must include $200 in their income tax return.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, at the request of an individual unitholder, net income may
            be distributed instead to certain related persons, typically family
            members such as partners and children, in much the same way as a
            discretionary trust. This means, for example, Crosby may nominate a
            family member, such as Mitchell, to receive all or part of their net
            income.
          </p>
          <p>
            A draft minute of a meeting of directors recording this decision is
            included in the appendix.
          </p>

          <h5>When will a hybrid trust be used?</h5>
          <p>Hybrid trusts are particularly useful where:</p>
          <p>
            1. two or more unrelated persons co-own a business or an investment
            and
          </p>
          <p>
            2. there is a potential to distribute income and capital gains and
            tax credits and rebates to related persons.
          </p>
          <h5>Advantages of hybrid trusts</h5>
          <p>More particularly, the advantages of a hybrid trust include:</p>
          <p>
            1. they are cheap to set up and run each year. They eliminate the
            need to set up multiple entities for each owner and prepare multiple
            accounts, BASs and tax returns each year;
          </p>
          <p>
            2. unit holders can claim a deduction for the interest incurred on
            the cost of their units. A beneficiary of a discretionary trust is
            not able to do this. This has an intrinsic tax planning value, but
            also means it is less likely for a trust to have “quarantined”
            interest losses ie losses that are locked up and cannot be used by
            related persons. This can happen, for example, if a trust borrows
            money to negatively gear an investment property, or if a trading
            trust incurs business losses;
          </p>
          <p>
            3. it is easy for new owners to join and for old owners to leave the
            structure. It is a simple sale of unit transaction. This can be
            completed efficiently with low legal fees, if any;
          </p>
          <p>
            4. because the discretionary beneficiaries are defined by their
            relationship with the unit holder, a transfer of a unit or an issue
            of a unit to a new unit holder automatically introduces a new class
            of beneficiaries without the need to amend documents or, for
            example, end one partnership and start a new one, with the attendant
            tax consequences and extra costs;
          </p>
          <p>
            5. the interests of each owner are protected and are not subject to
            a discretionary power on the part of the trustee. The resolutions to
            distribute net income other than proportionately must be signed by
            each unit holder: this protects each unit holder from unfair
            treatment. This means the unit’s capital value is preserved and it
            has a market value and can be bought and sold. This compares to a
            beneficiary of a discretionary trust who only has a mere expectancy
            that the trustee may exercise a discretion in its favour. Such a
            beneficiary does not have a separate asset recognised at law; and
          </p>
          <p>
            6. the difficulties experienced with section 160ZM of the Income Tax
            Assessment Act 1936 (“the Act”), where non-assessable income erodes
            indexed cost base or riggers a deemed capital gain, can be avoided.
            This is done by allocating this income to a discretionary
            beneficiary. This means, for example, problems with
            (under-capitalised) unit trusts realising tax exempt capital gains
            on the sale of business goodwill can be avoided.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the other tax laws applying generally to trusts, including the
            loss trust rules and the restrictions on channelling franking
            credits, apply.
          </p>
          <h5>Disadvantages of Hybrid Trusts</h5>
          <p>
            A hybrid trust cannot distribute capital or revenue losses to its
            unit holders. This means a trust incur a net loss its beneficiaries
            will not be able to offset that loss against any other assessable
            income that they may derive. The position would be different if, for
            example, a partnership structure was used: partners can offset
            partnership losses against other income.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expert advice should be sought if it a trust expects to make a
            revenue loss or a capital loss for tax purposes. It may be wise to
            have debt held at the unit holder level, rather than the trust
            level, to avoid negative gearing type losses being locked up in the
            trust.
          </p>
          <h5>Land Tax and Hybrid Trusts</h5>
          <p>
            Complex land tax rules may apply where a hybrid trust owns
            significant real estate, particularly under the NSW and Victorian
            Special Trust rules.
          </p>
          <h5>Stamp Duty and Hybrid Trusts</h5>
          <p>
            Complex stamp duty rules may apply where a hybrid trust owns
            significant real estate, particularly when beneficial ownership
            changes.
          </p>
          <h5>Income Tax and Hybrid Trusts</h5>
          <p>
            Hybrid trusts are efficient tax planning vehicles. Usually hybrid
            trusts do not pay tax themselves. Instead the net income flows
            through and is attributed to the unit holders. The amount of tax
            paid by the unit holders depends on their individual tax profiles.
            For example, a unit holder with $100,000 of carried forward tax
            losses will not pay tax on a distribution of $10,000. This is
            because the unit holder’s taxable income will still be less than nil
            (ie $100,000 less $10,000, ie a $90,000 carry forward loss). Another
            unit holder in the top marginal tax bracket may pay up to $4,500
            tax, plus Medicare levy on a distribution of $10,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trust deed is drafted so franking credits, dividend rebates, and
            different classes of income, capital gains (and other tax amounts
            with particular tax consequences) flow through the trust to the
            appropriate unit holders.
          </p>
          <p>
            The taxation of trusts is complex. Particular complications may
            arise with the Small Business CGT concessions and carry forward tax
            losses. It’s not possible to cover the field in a few short pages,
            particularly as the rules change frequently over time. This means
            expert advice should be sought before making any tax sensitive
            decisions about hybrid trusts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ATO generally accepts hybrid trusts but is concerned about some
            gearing arrangements. In summary, expert advice should be sought
            before claiming large interest deductions on the cost of units
            and/or distributing significant net income to someone other than the
            original unitholder. As a general proposition interest deductions
            and net income distributions must match up. Discretionary
            distribution powers should not be used for tax avoidance purposes.
          </p>
          <h5>Do you need a unitholders’ agreement?</h5>
          <p>
            Most hybrid trusts with unrelated unitholders need a unitholders’
            agreement. This agreement will set out a dispute resolution
            mechanism, basic rules concerning the ownership and sale of units
            and, importantly, which unitholder does what, where and when.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best time to do this is at the beginning while everyone is still
            friends.
